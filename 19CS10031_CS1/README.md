### CS1-Cricket Format Clustering using Single Linkage Hierarchical Clustering Technique

To run the code we need Numpy, Matplotlib and pandas library pre-installed.

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Given command will install all the required packages.

My code contains two files 19CS10031_CS1.py and 19CS10031_CS1.ipynb file.

both the file contains nearly the same code.

.py file contains all parts in sequential order and for running it simply  type.

```bash
$ python 19CS10031_CS1.py
```

**If python is not working try pip3 and python3 respectively.**

this will print results of all part in sequential part.

.ipynb contains same code in addition with few plotting functions for plotting **k vs silhouette coefficient.**

for running this file open it in Jupiter notebook or colab and run every cell from top to down.

### .py file takes approximately 10-20 seconds for running 

**for changing input file change line 302 and for changing random seed change line 21**
